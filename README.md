# Weather Recommendations App

This light Django app was built to learn about the Django framework and begin to solve a problem that many people with neurological and/or learning disabilities struggle with every day weather-appropriate clothing choices.

This Stage 1 Minimum Viable Product shows the weather in given locations and provides some general recomendations for those weather conditions.

It uses OpenWeatherAPI to get basic temperature data as well as an icon to display.

You can add as many locations as you'd like. If you try to add one that already exists, it will return an error.

### Planned stage 2:

- Set up user login and authentication.
- Create a database to store user uploaded clothing, catagorised into types such as 't-shirt' or 'dress'.
- Display all of the clothes that user has that would suit the current temperature range.

### Stage 3:

- Use AI and ML to determine which colours go together to create a good outfit.
